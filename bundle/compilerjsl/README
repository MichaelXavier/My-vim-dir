This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2630

Compiler plugin for JavaScript Lint (http://www.javascriptlint.com), an (open
source) checker for JavaScript syntax and coding techniques based on the Mozilla
Firefox JavaScript engine. 

This is similar to vimscript #2578 and vimscript #2729, but this script uses
Vim's compiler infrastructure (so checks are triggered by the :make command),
making its use consistent with syntax checkers for other languages.
